          Document Redirection can be a serious PITA#In today&amp;rsquo;s world of COVID with so many people working from home, more and more organizations are moving to cloud services for file storage. It used to be quite a common practice, at least in my experience to enable folder redirection for users on-prem. Trying to dismantle folder redirection, especially when our users are working remotely can prove to be a challenge.

          The Problem#So you want to move your files to SharePoint, great! But your users don&amp;rsquo;t understand sharepoint, don&amp;rsquo;t wanna learn sharepoint and just want their file explorer experience.
There are a few ways we can go about syncing libraries for our users. We can set a group policy or Intune configuration to automatically sync a SharePoint library however there are some big caveats with this such as a 250~ url character limit.
