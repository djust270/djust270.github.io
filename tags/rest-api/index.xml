          What is an API anyway? API stands for &amp;ldquo;Application Interface&amp;rdquo;. In simplest terms, APIs are services that bridge and allow two systems to interact. When we are talking about web services, such as those in M365, API usually refer to a REST API. I like this explanation from AWS:
 API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server.
