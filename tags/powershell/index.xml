          What is an API anyway? API stands for &amp;ldquo;Application Interface&amp;rdquo;. In simplest terms, APIs are services that bridge and allow two systems to interact. When we are talking about web services, such as those in M365, API usually refer to a REST API. I like this explanation from AWS:
 API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server.

      <title>PowerShell Project - Get the Weather report</title>

          I thought it would be a fun project to create a PowerShell function which would get the Weather forecast for a specified location.
I started searching online for free Weather REST APIs which I could query for the forecast. I found api.weather.gov which has a completely free and open REST API with complete documentation API Web Service (weather.gov). Checking the documentation, the REST endpoint to query the forecast is https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{grid X},{grid Y}/forecast.

      <title>Export O365 User License Report with friendly names</title>

          I was recently tasked with exporting a report for a client that detailed all users, their location and license assignment in Office 365. I knew the best way to get the job done was by writing a PowerShell script.
I did a quick search online and found lots of examples, however all the examples I found were using the deprecated &amp;ldquo;Microsoft Online&amp;rdquo; / MSOL PS module. I wanted to use the Azure AD module instead so I played around a bit to get the output I wanted.

      <title>Remove Document Redirection Policies over VPN</title>

          In today&amp;rsquo;s world of COVID with so many people working from home, more and more organizations are moving to cloud services for file storage. It used to be quite a common practice, at least in my experience to enable folder redirection for users on-prem. Trying to dismantle folder redirection, especially when our users are working remotely can prove to be a challenge. If you have ever attempted to remove a folder redirection GPO, you have undoubtedly discovered folder redirection policies only apply (and remove) at startup/user logon.

      <title>Sync SharePoint Libraries with PowerShell</title>

          The Problem So you want to move your files to SharePoint, great! But your users don&amp;rsquo;t understand sharepoint, don&amp;rsquo;t wanna learn sharepoint and just want their file explorer experience.
There are a few ways we can go about syncing libraries for our users. We can set a group policy or Intune configuration to automatically sync a SharePoint library however there are some big caveats with this such as a 250~ url character limit.
