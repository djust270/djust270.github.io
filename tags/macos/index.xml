          Setup BYOD Enrollment In part 1, we explored how to setup a macOS virtual machine for testing. Now lets look at actually configuring Intune. The first thing we need to do is get an Apple MDM push certificate.
 Navigate to endpoint.microsoft.com &amp;lt; Devices &amp;lt; Enroll Devices &amp;lt; Apple Enrollment. Download the CSR. Follow the link “Create your MDM Push Certificate” Sign into your Apple ID (or create one if you do not have one) Click create certificate.

          Premise
One of my clients has an Apple only environment. The client was previously managed with Jamf. Jamf is a great MDM platform for Apple devices and works really well however there are some downsides. First, the cost of Jamf is quite high, also while Jamf does support M365 condtional access and SSO with M365, it requires a bit more configuration than Intune does. My client was already paying for Enterprise mobility and Security licensing through M365 with Defender ATP for Endpoint so why not take advantage of the included Intune licensing?
