          Ever since the WinGet package manager was announced, I wanted to find ways to leverage the package manager to simplify deploying software to endpoints. After doing some research and testing, I found that WinGet was unfortunately not designed to be run in SYSTEM context. It was designed to be run under a user account. There is an open issue on GitHub currently and many admins, myself included, would really like WinGet to be designed with enterprise use in mind.

          Premise
One of my clients has an Apple only environment. The client was previously managed with Jamf. Jamf is a great MDM platform for Apple devices and works really well however there are some downsides. First, the cost of Jamf is quite high, also while Jamf does support M365 condtional access and SSO with M365, it requires a bit more configuration than Intune does. My client was already paying for Enterprise mobility and Security licensing through M365 with Defender ATP for Endpoint so why not take advantage of the included Intune licensing?
